Welcome to the USGS Earthquake Data Visualization project! The United States Geological Survey (USGS) plays a crucial role in providing scientific insights into natural hazards, environmental health, and the impacts of climate change. As stewards of vast amounts of global earthquake data, the USGS recognizes the need for innovative tools to effectively visualize and communicate their findings.

In this repository, we tackle the challenge of developing cutting-edge visualization tools for USGS earthquake data. Our mission is to create a meaningful and informative platform that not only educates the public but also serves as a valuable resource for government organizations. Through this initiative, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of our planet's seismic activities and garner support for essential research and initiatives. Explore, contribute, and join us in making a positive impact through data-driven insights.

## Project Completion Overview
This project successfully visualizes earthquake data sourced from the USGS GeoJSON Feed. Leveraging Leaflet, a dynamic map was created to plot earthquakes based on latitude and longitude. The data markers are strategically designed to reflect earthquake magnitude through size and depth through color intensity.

### Key Features:
1. Data Integration:
Accessed real-time earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed, ensuring up-to-date information for visualization.

2. Interactive Map:
Implemented a Leaflet map to dynamically plot earthquake locations, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

3. Visual Cues:
Employed marker size to represent earthquake magnitude and color intensity to convey depth, enhancing the visual impact of the map.

4. Informative Popups:
Incorporated popups for each marker, offering users additional details about the corresponding earthquake upon interaction.

5. Legend Creation:
Designed a comprehensive legend to assist users in interpreting the map data, contributing to a more informed understanding.

## Project Impact:
The completed visualization serves as a powerful tool for comprehending real-time earthquake occurrences globally. By combining visual elements and interactive features, this project aims to enhance public awareness, facilitate educational exploration, and contribute to a better understanding of seismic activities worldwide.
